Great question. Let's walk through **how variables like `char`, `int`, and `double` are stored**, using C++ as a reference. We'll go **from high-level C++ code** all the way down to **electrons and transistors**—layer by layer:

---

## Overview of Variable Storage (Top-Down)

1. **C++ Code (High Level)**
2. **Assembly Instructions (Compiler Output)**
3. **Memory Allocation (RAM)**
4. **CPU & RAM Interaction (Registers & Bus)**
5. **Binary Representation of Data (Bits & Bytes)**
6. **Hardware Level (Transistors & Charges)**

---

## 1. C++ Code

In C++, you might write:

```cpp
char c = 'A';     // 1 byte
int i = 123;      // typically 4 bytes
double d = 3.14;  // typically 8 bytes
```

Each variable is:

* Assigned a **data type**.
* Given **storage space in memory**.
* Converted to **binary** before storage.

---

## 2. Compilation to Assembly

Your C++ compiler translates this into **assembly**, which contains instructions like:

```asm
mov BYTE PTR [rbp-1], 65        ; char c = 'A'
mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 123      ; int i = 123
mov QWORD PTR [rbp-8], 40091EB851EB851F ; double d = 3.14 (hex)
```

This tells the CPU:

* Reserve specific addresses (e.g., `[rbp-1]`, `[rbp-4]`, etc.)
* Move binary representations into those addresses.

## 3. Memory Allocation in RAM

### What happens in RAM?

RAM is a big grid of **bytes (8 bits)**, each with a unique **address**:

* When `char c = 'A';` is declared, 1 byte is reserved.
* `int` reserves 4 contiguous bytes.
* `double` reserves 8 contiguous bytes.

RAM layout (example):

| Address   | Content (hex)      | Purpose           |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 0x7fffdc4 | `41`               | `'A'` (`char`)    |
| 0x7fffdc0 | `0000007B`         | `123` (`int`)     |
| 0x7fffdb8 | `40091EB851EB851F` | `3.14` (`double`) |

---

## 4. CPU & RAM Interaction

* **CPU Registers** (e.g., `RAX`, `RBX`) temporarily hold variable values.
* **Memory Bus** transmits data to/from RAM.
* The **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** translates virtual addresses into physical RAM locations.

### Access example:

When you read `i`, the CPU:

* Uses the address stored in the symbol table for `i`.
* Sends the address via the **address bus**.
* Reads 4 bytes from that location via the **data bus**.

---

## 5. Binary Representation of Types

### `char c = 'A';`

* ASCII code of `'A'` is `65`
* Binary: `01000001`

### `int i = 123;`

* Decimal `123` → Binary: `00000000 00000000 00000000 01111011`

### `double d = 3.14;`

* Stored in IEEE-754 64-bit format:

  * Binary (approx): `0100000000001001000111101011100001010001111010111000010100011111`

Each data type has:

* **Size** (in bytes)
* **Encoding format** (e.g., two's complement for `int`, IEEE 754 for `double`)

---

## 6. Physical Storage in Hardware

### How are bits stored?

In **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**:

* Each bit is stored in a **capacitor + transistor pair**.
* A charged capacitor = `1`, discharged = `0`.
* The capacitor must be **refreshed** thousands of times per second.

### In **SRAM (used in CPU caches)**:

* Each bit is stored using **6 transistors** in a flip-flop.
* Faster but more expensive.

So, storing `char c = 'A';` means:

* 8 capacitors in RAM are charged/discharged to match the bit pattern `01000001`.

## Summary Table

| Type     | Size | Binary (Example)                          | Hardware      |
| -------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `char`   | 1 B  | `01000001` (ASCII `'A'`)                  | 8 capacitors  |
| `int`    | 4 B  | `00000000 00000000 00000000 01111011`     | 32 capacitors |
| `double` | 8 B  | `01000000 00001001 ...` (IEEE 754 format) | 64 capacitors |
