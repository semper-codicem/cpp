## üéØ Introduction

Variables are at the heart of every C++ program. They allow us to store data, manipulate it, and make decisions. Understanding variables thoroughly is essential for writing efficient, bug-free, and high-performance code.

---

## üß± Fundamentals

### What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a named memory location that stores a value. It allows data to be reused and manipulated during program execution.

### Variable Declaration and Initialization

```cpp
int age;             // Declaration
age = 25;            // Assignment
int score = 100;     // Declaration + Initialization
```

**Syntax:**

```cpp
<type> <variable_name> = <initial_value>;
```

### Primitive Data Types

| Type     | Size (Typical) | Range (Signed)                  |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `int`    | 4 bytes        | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `float`  | 4 bytes        | ¬±3.4e‚àí38 to ¬±3.4e+38            |
| `double` | 8 bytes        | ¬±1.7e‚àí308 to ¬±1.7e+308          |
| `char`   | 1 byte         | -128 to 127                     |
| `bool`   | 1 byte         | `true` or `false`               |

### Type Modifiers

* `signed`, `unsigned` (e.g., `unsigned int`)
* `short`, `long`, `long long`

```cpp
unsigned int counter = 100;
long long bigNumber = 9223372036854775807LL;
```

### Constants

```cpp
const double PI = 3.14159;
#define MAX_USERS 1000  // Macro constant (not type-safe)
```

---

## üîÅ Intermediate Concepts

### Scope and Lifetime

* **Local variables** exist within a block (`{}`).
* **Global variables** are accessible throughout the file.
* **Static variables** persist across function calls.

```cpp
void demo() {
    static int counter = 0;
    counter++;
    std::cout << counter << std::endl;
}
```

### Storage Classes

| Storage Class | Keyword    | Scope        | Lifetime         |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Automatic     | default    | Local        | Until block ends |
| Static        | `static`   | Local/Global | Entire program   |
| External      | `extern`   | Global       | Entire program   |
| Register      | `register` | Local        | Until block ends |

### Type Deduction with `auto`

```cpp
auto num = 42;       // Deduces int
auto pi = 3.14;      // Deduces double
```

### References

```cpp
int a = 10;
int &ref = a;
ref = 20;  // a becomes 20
```

* A reference is an alias to another variable.
* Must be initialized when declared.

### Pointers

```cpp
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;
*ptr = 30;  // x becomes 30
```

* Store the address of variables.
* Can point to any type (`int*`, `char*`, `void*`).

---

## üß† Advanced Topics

### Const Correctness

* Prevents unintended modification.

```cpp
void print(const int& value);
// value cannot be changed inside print
```

* Const pointers:

```cpp
const int *ptr1;  // pointer to const int
int *const ptr2;  // const pointer to int
const int *const ptr3; // const pointer to const int
```

### Volatile Keyword

Tells the compiler not to optimize access to the variable:

```cpp
volatile int flag;
```

Used for memory-mapped I/O, multithreaded code, or signals.

### Mutable Keyword

Allows a member of a `const` object to be modified.

```cpp
class Logger {
    mutable int accessCount;
public:
    void log() const {
        accessCount++; // Allowed due to 'mutable'
    }
};
```

### Static Variables in Classes

```cpp
class Counter {
    static int count;
public:
    static void increment() { ++count; }
};
int Counter::count = 0;  // Definition
```

Shared across all instances.

### Thread-local Variables

```cpp
thread_local int counter = 0;
```

Each thread has its own copy.

### Unions and Bit-fields

#### Union

```cpp
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
};
```

All members share the same memory.

#### Bit-fields

```cpp
struct Flags {
    unsigned int flag1 : 1;
    unsigned int flag2 : 1;
};
```

Efficient way to store multiple boolean flags.

### Extern and Linkage

Used to access a global variable defined in another file.

```cpp
// In file1.cpp
int sharedValue = 42;

// In file2.cpp
extern int sharedValue;
```

## üß≠ Best Practices

* Always initialize variables.
* Prefer `const` and `constexpr` where applicable.
* Minimize global variables.
* Use `auto` with care ‚Äì for readability and maintainability.
* Avoid using uninitialized pointers or references.
* Use references over pointers when null values are not acceptable.
* Ensure const correctness in function parameters.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Mastering variables in C++ means understanding not just syntax, but also memory management, type semantics, and lifetime behavior. From simple integers to advanced const references and thread-local storage, variables form the building blocks of your logic and architecture.

By learning how to use them efficiently and safely, you build a strong foundation for all C++ programming ‚Äî from embedded systems to high-performance applications.
